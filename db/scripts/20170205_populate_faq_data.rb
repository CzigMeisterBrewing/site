  question: "How often will you change beers?",
  answer:   "We have our 4 staple beers that will be on tap all year round and each seasonal beer will rotate every two to three months. We will also have specialty “one-off” beers that rotate about every week. Once the kegs that hold the “one-offs” are kicked they’re gone so get them while they last!"

  question: "Are there tours?",
  answer:   "Of course!  We want you to learn the fascinating step-by-step process of how the beer gets into your glass.  We encourage every visitor to tour our brewery, get familiar about brewing in general and about the styles of beer that we offer on tap.  There are tours given every hour on the hour, and we have educational displays throughout the brewery so that you can give yourself a self-guided tour if you wish. If you are interested in a tour for yourself or your group, just ask one of our tasting room team and we’ll be happy to give you one."
